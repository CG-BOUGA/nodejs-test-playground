NODE JS is a quite simple language.

Once you have understand and learn all NodeJS, Arrow functions, Promises, advanced performances, async callback, require var vs const and all this stuff, come back here and try this sadic and extremely difficult puzzle.

@[In this exercise, you need to understand this !$? code and return the most extremely known word "hello"]({"stubs": ["hello.js"], "command": "test.js"})

If you are here, you are probably one of the best NodeJS expert of the world, you can just say thank you to me.
