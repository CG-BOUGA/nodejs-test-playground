# Welcome to NODEJS

Node.js is a quite simple language.

Once you have understood and learned everything in NodeJS (arrow functions,
async callbacks, promises, advanced performance, require var vs const and all
this stuff), come back here and try this sadic and extremely difficult puzzle.

@[Hello world (aside)]({"stubs": ["hello.js"], "command": "test.js", "layout": "aside"})

@[Hello world (inline default)]({"stubs": ["hello.js"], "command": "test.js"})

?[Quizz description text](multiple)
- [x] answer 1
- [x] answer 2

If you are here, you are probably one of the best NodeJS expert of the world, you can just say thank you to me.
